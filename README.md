# Svendless
I have unfortunately been very fond of timewasters like Cookie Clicker in my past, and have always thought that, given how algorithmic every facet of a typical clicker is, why should they ever need to end? Of course, a human programmer will eventually run out of ideas for context-based clicker machines, or story advancement, etc. but why can't these be auto-generated as well? Svendless is a project which I will incrementally improve strictly in whatever free time I have available, to create a fully generative clicker game, with visualization, lore, events, etc. that is fully procedural and unique upon every restart. Other side goals:
    * Some more in-depth economy system (interaction and simulated interaction between agents)
    * Possible lose-state based on economy system
    * Generative: "Machines", resources (?), lore, events, visualization, agents,
```
